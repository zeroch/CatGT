# Introduction. 
CatGT is project that we connect cat's owner with cat through internet of things. 

# Git control 

**Ze and Zhen** are working on the microcontroller part, use **mbed branch**. 

**Yating and Ivan** on the server side. use **server branch**. and **Zeheng**, maybe use **server** too. 

Because mbed have to build from cloud, and server code use build by local. so I don't want to mess up the code.  

# Goal.

1. stepper motor with lazer. 
2. remote control the stepper motor. 
3. camera can conbine with above system .
4. leep motion controller with above.
